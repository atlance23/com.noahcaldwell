								<h3>March 2024</h3>
								<p>My story starts in March 2024</p>
								<p>My mother had just placed me under contract to pay $3000/month for the priveleges of transportation to work and living in my parents house. She was doing this to force me into an ulitmatum. Choose my girlfriend or choose my mom.</p>
								<p>I wasn't going to make that choice, so I created a third option. Scrapped together everything I had, got a car, and moved as far away as I could.</p>

								<h3>September 2024</h3>
								<p>August 31st, 2024, I came home from work. Life was great, I was happy. I had escaped the abusive situation I was in as a child. I had a beautiful girlfriend I adored, and I was bonus dad to a beautiful little girl. Life had other plans...</p>
								<p>I went to sleep the night of August 31st, 2024 at roughly 9pm. I woke up the next day September 1st, 2024 in an ambulance at 5pm.</p>
								<p>I had an insulin pump malfunction in my sleep. My insulin pump poured 300 units of Humalog into my body over 8 hours. I did not wake up. My heart stopped beating, and I stopped breathing. This was a Saturday, so I was supposed to pick my girlfriend and her daughter up from her parents hours for our date at 10AM.</p>
								<p>I never showed up. She called, and called, and called. No answer. She started to panic, it wasn't like me to not answer my phone. At 4pm she had her mom drive her to my house to check on me. They walk into the bedroom. It's quiet, dark, and the gentle hum of the ceiling fan ran in the background.</p>
								<p>Everything seemed normal, she thought I was asleep, but her mom instincts kicked in and said something wasn't right. She walked closer, looked at the pillow. Blood. Lots of blood. I had been seizing for 10+ hours and had chewed holes in my teeth and gums from the seizures.</p>
								<p>They checked for a pulse. None. They checked for breathing. None. They called EMS, who were able to get me revived and in the ambulance. EMS checked my blood sugar... it was 0.7.</p>
								<p>I was able to make a full recovery, however, I did have brain hypoxia. I had amnesia, and could not remember anything before I died. My bosses at my job told HR that I was planning on filing for short term disability because of this (which was true), and I received a call from HR terminating my employment before I could finish the application.</p>
								<p>So, now here I was, just died, now jobless, and about to be homeless. I had to do something, so I found Uber!</p>

								<h3>June 2025</h3>
								<p>Things had been a struggle since last September. Life had not been easy, nor forgiving. But the most brutal thing happened in June. My girlfriend, the one who saved my life, left without explanation.</p>
								<p>It came out through mutual friends that she had been telling people she was a lesbian and she had never dated me, rather, I was her stalker. They asked me, and I told them what actually happened. I even showed them the stark lack of "restraining orders" on my record (because those are public record for the defendant).</p>
								<p>These kind of lies continued, to the point it was starting to cause issues for me for employment opportunities. So, I reach out to her parents, told them the situtation, and waited to see if I would get a response.</p>
								<p>The response I got, was not what I was expecting. Her parents apologized for her was doing that. They said she never needed the money I sent her $17,000+, she lied about her sister having cancer, she lied to them about me moving here, she never told them I sold everything I owned to pawn shops to "feed her kid", and that she lied about pretty much everything.</p>
								<p>This was world shattering. I had moved here thinking I had a family, and now not only did I have nothing. I was completely alone. That broke me. But, as far as I could see it, I had a choice to make. Let this define me or become jaded, or become a version of myself that I am proud of, someone who has been though what I have and still chooses to help others.</p>
								<p>So, I still do Uber, listen to people's stories, learn about people's lives, listen to their dreams, their hopes, and root for them to achieve them with them. Because I know as well as anyone else that anything is possible.</p>

								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p>All of this being said, thank you for choosing to ride Uber with me! Please remember to tip, if you have the means to. I am still late on rent and car payment because of the stuff I am still digging myself out of. Any bit helps. I hope you enjoy the ride and have a safe trip home!</p>
